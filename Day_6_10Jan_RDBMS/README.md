##  Enterprise Assignment questions

 1) We have an enterprise that buys products from different supplying companies, and we would like to keep track of our data by means of database

2) We would like to keep track of what kind of products(ex: cars) we buy, and from which supplier(ex: manufacturer1) we buy them. We can buy each product from several suppliers. Further, we want to know the price of the products. The price of a product is naturally dependent on which supplier we bought it from

3) We would also like to store the address of each supplier, i.e. the city where the supplier is located. Here, we assume that each supplier is only located at one place

4) We need to order a large number of cars from Manufacturer1. It can then be good to know how many people that live in the city where Manufacturer1 is located. Thus, we can know Manufacturer1 can employ a sufficient amount of people to produce the cars. Hence we also store the population for each city
